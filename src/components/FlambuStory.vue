      <p class="mb-4">
        Flambu is a social platform for sharing, borrowing, buying and selling items from nearby people. You can buy from the sellers or borrow from people in your neighborhood. Think about all the items you have in your flat, how much did they cost you? How often do you use them? What if, you can generate extra income from the things you own by renting them to your neighbours.

      <p class="mb-4">
        Our vision is to provide a solution to reduce overconsumption; one of humanity’s greatest challenges today. So we’re making it quick and easy for people to share their belongings. Our main purpose is to create a more sustainable environment with the help of a strong community. We wish to create a community highly involved in the cause.

      <p class="landing-sub-title bold-text text-center mb-4">Our story </p>
      <p class="mb-4">The story of Flambu began when we wanted to go camping for a week, but we didn’t have all the necessary equipment. During preparation, we were overwhelmed by the overall high cost of purchasing all the camping gear that we needed, including tents, chairs, tables, and shade. We even thought it would be nice to have a generator for electricity, but couldn’t afford it. So bought everything we could and almost never used them again. And we realized that this is not only for camping, but it is relevant for many experiences that we had or want to have, like a nice quality camera for a one time trip, or a piano to start a new hobby, a drone for a one time event, or a stroller for your baby in your destination when you go on a trip with your family. Today, when we need those items the only option seems to be buying, but this way of living is expensive, takes up so much space in our increasingly smaller apartments in the big cities and is not sustainable!</p>
      <p class="mb-4">So we thought; what if there was a place where people could rent the items they need in order to save time and money, also lend their unused items to others and make some extra money. This sounded like a Win-Win for everyone and also for the environment, so we started working on it right after the camping :)</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        You may wonder, but why name it Flambu, it’s such a strange name right? So there are two reasons: One it was inspired by a story that says a torch that shares its flame with another torch, doesn’t lose from its own flame, but oppositely creates even more light. This story really resonated with our idea of creating a place for sharing and helping. And the second reason is that the idea started with the camping experience and we were extremely excited talking about this around the campfire. So we came up with the name Flambu (as in Flambeau) which means torch.
